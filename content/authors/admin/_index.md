Wei-en (Annie) Wang is the doctoral student (ABD) of the [Lab for Rehabilitation Neuroscience](http://lrnlab.org/). Her research focuses on investigating brain mechanisms underlying motor and pain networks, and the impact of pain on motor behaviors. <br/>
This research combines brain imaging (EEG, MRI/fMRI), electrophysiology recordings (EMG), motor analysis, behavioral measures to study pain and movement.
